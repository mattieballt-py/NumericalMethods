This work proposes a review of the most common of these methods. It is mainly focused on model-based nonlinear control methods and guidance principles. Notably, this work details examples and variations of model-based linearizing controllers, applications of line of sight guidance, sliding mode controllers and several other less common control methods for both fully-actuated and underactuated vehicles. Additionally, this work proposes an alternative definition of underactuation with respect to the task allowing for a better understanding of the consequences of underactuation on control. Comparison of fully-actuated and underactuated cases shows how control laws can be used to solve the problems of underactuation and what mechanisms can be used to compensate for the lack of actuation on a degree of freedom. The reviewed methods are compared and discussed with respect to their capabilities, limitations and suitability for typical tasks.},

This paper deals with the adaptive disturbance observer design for the robust trajectory tracking problem for underwater vehicles in presence of unknown external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. First, the dynamics of the vehicle is transformed into the so-called regular form. Then, based on the Extended State Observer technique and High Order Sliding Modes Control, a disturbance observer is proposed. Furthermore, the gains of the observer are automatically adjusted by the introduction of an adaption law. The stability of the whole controller/observer scheme is proven using Lyapunov's arguments. The adaptive disturbance observer aims to improve the Backstepping and nonlinear PD controllers. Real-Time experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the trajectory tracking task under several scenarios.},

This paper focuses on the design and agile motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in subsea environments, addressing key issues such as structural design, system modeling, and control algorithm development. An optimization model for the arrangement of propellers is formulated and solved using a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is employed for hydrodynamic analysis and shape optimization. A novel adaptive event-triggered nonlinear model predictive control (AET-NMPC) algorithm is proposed and compared with traditional Cascaded Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control and event-triggered cascaded PID control algorithms. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the AET-NMPC algorithm significantly enhances the response capability and control accuracy of underwater robots in complex tasks, with the trajectory tracking error being reduced to 4.89%.

A radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is utilized to handle the model uncertainties. By prescribed performance functions, the transient performance of the system can be guaranteed. The continuous Gaussian error function is represented as an approximation of asymmetric saturation nonlinearity such that the backstepping technique can be leveraged in the control design. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, residual function approximation inaccuracies and external disturbances are compensated by constructed adaptive control laws. As a consequence, all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors bounded by prescribed functions converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. The proposed method is applied to the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with extensive simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In order to eliminate tracking errors, three adaptive variables are constructed to design the guidance law instead of the unmeasurable ocean currents and sideslip angle, and the adaptive variables are adjusted online according to the tracking errors. The desired heading angle is computed by using the designed guidance law, then a heading controller based on backstepping method is designed to track the desired heading angle, so as to realize the path following of USVs.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. * Equal contribution.

First, we define the proposed docking task in terms of its observations, actions, and reward function, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical DRL research and docking algorithms tested on real vehicles. Additionally, we introduce a novel observation space that combines raw noisy observations with filtered data obtained using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through simulations with various DRL algorithms, showing that the proposed observations can produce stable policies in fewer learning steps, outperforming not only traditional control methods but also policies obtained by the same DRL algorithms in noise-free environments.},

Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows. Future developments in AUV technology of potential relevance to marine geoscience include new vehicles with enhanced hovering, long endurance, extreme depth, or rapid response capabilities, while development of new sensors will further expand the range of geochemical parameters that can be measured. © 2014 The Authors.},

These technologies have limitations related to speed, efficiency, maneuverability, and prolonged operation in ocean environments. To address and overcome these limitations, systems are being developed utilizing bio-inspired features and different swim modes. This leads to an issue where there is not a consistent measure with which can accurately predict the performance of platforms across many different swim modes. One widely used metric is the Cost of Transport over Reynolds number and displacements, in the form of a scaling law, which is a measure of the energy used for any given operation, but is highly dependent on the swimming mode and geometry of the platform. More recently, the Swim number was introduced that unifies the kinematics and fluid properties of many different aquatic animals and swim modes under a single scaling law. In this work, we introduce a Swim number for propeller driven autonomous swimmers as a unified performance metric. We review the Cost of Transport and Swim number for biological, bio-inspired, and conventional swimmers and provide new scaling laws. The analysis shows that both performance metrics taken together, Cost of Transport and Swim Number, are convenient when designing and comparing natural and artificial swimmers.},

Subsequently, we proposed DLMPC-based position tracking and velocity tracking controllers, which solved an online optimization problem to determine optimal velocities and control forces. This hierarchical framework effectively managed system constraints, such as state constraints and actuator saturation. Additionally, the Lyapunov-based backstepping control law was applied to construct stability constraints in the distributed optimization problem, ensuring the recursive feasibility and closed-loop system stability of the proposed scheme. Sufficient conditions and attraction regions to ensure stability were explicitly provided.

Such a threat is mainly due to human factors such as fishing net entanglement. This entanglement often comes at the expense of turtles losing a pectoral flipper. The reduction in a sea turtle’s survival odds upon losing a flipper is a significant concern. This issue extends beyond individual animals, as the potential extinction of sea turtles could have detrimental effects on ocean health and subsequently disrupt our lifestyles. In this work, with the help of robotics, we tested the suitability of a prosthetic flipper for sea turtles that have lost a flipper. Testing with our sea-turtle-inspired robot helped to demonstrate the prosthetic flipper’s performance without clinical trials in live animals. The robot showed that the prosthetic could closely mimic the sea turtle’s downstroke and upstroke, allowing the animal to regain control in roll, pitch, and yaw, despite the absence of anatomical joints and related muscles. Additionally, swim speed tests provided an average swim speed of 0.487 m/s while dragging 6 m of cable to give a calculated maximum swim speed of 0.618 m/s, coming close to the average swim speed of wild sea turtles of 0.6 m/s. Our aspiration is that the findings from this study will pave the way for an open-source implant design, empowering veterinary professionals globally to aid injured turtles. Furthermore, this research promises to inspire additional animal-based robotic designs, advancing technologies geared towards assisting other animals in distress.},

Firstly, by using the sliding mode control method, an FSMC is proposed for reducing the tracking errors. Secondly, considering the estimation problem of time-varying disturbances, a fixed-time DO is designed to reconstruct the information of the AUV. Finally, The DO can compensate time-varying disturbances and the FSMC can reduce the tracking errors incorporating the information from the DO. Thus, the FSMC-DO for AUV is derived. Compared with the conventional FSMC and the finite time controller, the proposed FSMC-DO not only offers a faster convergence rate but also a higher tracking accuracy and robustness for the trajectory tracking control of AUVs. Simulation results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed FSMC-DO.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an extensive analysis of the integral line-of-sight (ILOS) guidance method for path-following tasks of underactuated marine vehicles, operating on and below the sea surface. It is shown that due to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines by compensating for the drift effect of environmental disturbances, such as currents, wind, and waves. The ILOS guidance is first applied to a 2-D model of surface vessels that includes the underactauted sway dynamics of the vehicle as well as disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, and forces. The actuated dynamics are not considered at this point. A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The actuated surge, pitch, and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis where the closed-loop system forms a cascade, and the properties of UGAS and ULES are shown. The 3-D ILOS control system is a generalization of the 2-D ILOS guidance. Finally, results from simulations and experiments are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results, where the 2-D ILOS guidance is applied to the cooperative autonomous robotics towing system vehicle and light AUV.},

In this paper, we propose an effective hybrid dynamic Transformer (called HDT-Net) for underwater image super-resolution, leveraging a collaborative exploration of both local and global information aggregation to help image restoration. Firstly, we introduce a dynamic local self-attention to adaptively capture important spatial details in degraded underwater images by employing dynamic weighting. Secondly, considering that visual transformers tend to introduce irrelevant information when modeling the global context, thereby interfering with the reconstruction of high-resolution images, we design a sparse non-local self-attention to more accurately compute self-similarity by setting a top-k threshold. Finally, we integrate these two self-attention mechanisms into the hybrid dynamic transformer module, constituting the primary feature extraction unit of our proposed method. Quantitative and qualitative analyses on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to previous CNN and Transformer models.},

Combined with dynamic sliding mode control (SMC), this model is applied to the dynamic trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). First, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation platform ANSYS Fluent is used to solve for the main hydrodynamic coefficients required to establish the AUV dynamic model. Then, the novel model predictive controller is used to obtain the desired velocity command of the AUV. To reduce the influence of external interference and realize accurate velocity tracking, dynamic SMC is used to obtain the control input command. In addition, stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method proves the asymptotic stability of the controller. Finally, the trajectory tracking performance of the AUV in an underwater, three-dimensional environment is verified by using the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform. The results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method.},

However, limited operational capability and sophisticated mission environments are also difficulties faced by AUV. To make better use of AUV in the search mission, we establish the DMACSS (distributed multi-AUVs collaborative search system) and propose the ACSLA (autonomous collaborative search learning algorithm) integrated into the DMACSS. Compared with the previous system, DMACSS adopts a distributed control structure to improve the system robustness and combines an information fusion mechanism and a time stamp mechanism, making each AUV in the system able to exchange and fuse information during the mission. ACSLA is an adaptive learning algorithm trained by the RL (Reinforcement learning) method with a tailored design of state information, reward function, and training framework, which can give the system optimal search path in real-time according to the environment. We test DMACSS and ACSLA in the simulation test. The test results demonstrate that the DMACSS runs stably, the search accuracy and efficiency of ACSLA outperform other search methods, thus better realizing the cooperation between AUVs, making the DMACSS find the target more accurately and faster.},

   abstract = {Sea turtles gracefully navigate their marine environments by flapping their pectoral flippers in an elegant routine to produce the required hydrodynamic forces required for locomotion. The propulsion of sea turtles has been shown to occur for approximately 30% of the limb beat, with the remaining 70% employing a drag-reducing glide. However, it is unknown how the sea turtle manipulates the flow during the propulsive stage. Answering this research question is a complicated process, especially when conducting laboratory tests on endangered animals, and the animal may not even swim with its regular routine while in a captive state. In this work, we take advantage of our robotic sea turtle, internally known as Cornelia, to offer the first insights into the flow features during the sea turtle’s propulsion cycle consisting of the downstroke and the sweep stroke. Comparing the flow features to the animal’s swim speed, flipper angle of attack, power consumption, thrust and lift production, we hypothesise how each of the flow features influences the animal’s propulsive efforts and cost of transport (COT). Our findings show that the sea turtle can produce extremely low COT values that point to the effectiveness of the sea turtle propulsive technique. Based on our findings, we extract valuable data that can potentially lead to turtle-inspired elements for high-efficiency underwater drones for long-term underwater missions.},

This collaboration between AI and biomimicry marks a new era for AUVs, enabling them to emulate marine creatures' graceful and efficient movements. By infusing AI capabilities into AUVs, AUVs are empowered to learn and adapt, making autonomous real-time decisions without human intervention. This dynamic integration equips AUVs to effectively navigate complex underwater terrains, evade obstacles, and seamlessly interact with marine life. Inspired by the remarkable propulsion mechanisms found in marine organisms, this work proposes a pioneering propulsion system tailored for AUVs. Taking cues from the locomotion of creatures like cuttlefish, the biomechanics is translated into a robotic propulsion system. The result is a fluid and energy-efficient propulsion method that mitigates the harmful effects of cavitation, thereby reducing noise pollution and minimizing disruption to marine ecosystems. This research evaluates the performance of on-device AI models for analyzing the sensing environment around the AUV and taking real-time images. This automated sensing and navigation method can help the AUVs independently navigate to the desired location along the water table. The propulsion is achieved by building a crankshaft mechanism and a unified mechanical design to convert rotational motion from a motor into a sinusoidal wave motion to replicate the cuttlefish locomotion pattern. The proposed underwater vehicle, Aquabot, is designed using Fusion 360 simulation and ANSYS software. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the autonomous underwater vehicle based on the environmental conditions, thus reducing energy consumption and enhancing aquatic vehicle efficiency.},

A mechanistic principle now unifies the varied dynamics of macroscopic swimmers. Inertial aquatic swimmers that use undulatory gaits range in length L from a few millimetres to 30 metres, across a wide array of biological taxa. Using elementary hydrodynamic arguments, we uncover a unifying mechanistic principle characterizing their locomotion by deriving a scaling relation that links swimming speed U to body kinematics (tail beat amplitude A and frequency ω) and fluid properties (kinematic viscosity ν). This principle can be simply couched as the power law Re ∼ Swα, where Re = UL/ν ≫ 1 and Sw = ω AL/ν, with α = 4/3 for laminar flows, and α = 1 for turbulent flows. Existing data from over 1,000 measurements on fish, amphibians, larvae, reptiles, mammals and birds, as well as direct numerical simulations are consistent with our scaling. We interpret our results as the consequence of the convergence of aquatic gaits to the performance limits imposed by hydrodynamics.},

   abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are widely used for the inspection of seabed pipelines. To address the issues of low trajectory tracking accuracy in AUV inspection processes due to uncertain ocean current disturbances, this paper designs a new dual-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Variable Universe S-plane algorithms (S-VUD FLC, where VUD represents Variable Universe Discourse and FLC represents Fuzzy Logic Control) to achieve three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory tracking of an over-actuated AUV under uncertain ocean current disturbances. This paper uses MPC as the outer-loop position controller and S-VUD FLC as the inner-loop speed controller. The outer-loop controller generates desired speed instructions that are passed to the inner-loop speed controller, while the inner-loop speed controller generates control input and uses a direct logic thrust distribution method that approaches optimal energy consumption to distribute the thrust generated by the propellers to the over-actuated AUV, achieving closed-loop tracking of the entire trajectory. When designing the outer-loop MPC controller, the actual control input constraints of the system are considered, and control increments are introduced to reduce control model errors and the impact of uncertain external disturbances on the actual AUV model parameters. When designing the inner-loop S-VUD FLC, the strong robustness of the variable universe fuzzy controller and the easy construction characteristics of the S-plane algorithm are combined, and integral action is introduced to improve the system’s tracking accuracy. The stability of the outer loop controller is proven by the Lyapunov method, and the stability of the inner loop controller is verified by simulation. Finally, simulations show that the over-actuated AUV has fast tracking processes and high tracking result accuracy under uncertain ocean current disturbances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the designed dual-loop controller.},

The re-planned trajectory is employed in controller design to restrict the magnitude of tracking errors, mitigating abrupt changes in velocity and control input. Secondly, the robustness to environmental disturbances is achieved by employing a tube-based model predictive controller. The control scheme consists of two controllers: one is a model predictive controller based on the nominal AUV model for reference tracking, and the other is a state-dependent feedback controller used to construct time-varying tubes so as to ensure that the perturbed system remains within a tube centered around the nominal trajectory. Under given assumptions, the proposed controller guarantees (local) input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system.

This paper proposes a lightweight Recurrent Transfer-Adaptive Learning (RTAL) to improve the recognition accuracy of SSS images. In this work, (1) we analyze the target features collected by multiple AUVs, calculate the similarity between features using Mahalanobis distance, and establish a threshold. (2) When the threshold is higher than the similarity, AUVs adopt improved Recurrent Transfer Learning (RTL) to reduce computational consumption and ensure the real-time performance of the algorithm. (3) When the similarity is lower than the threshold, AUVs adopt RTAL to reconstruct the data of the target information with inconspicuous features caused by the complex background, extract features efficiently, and reduce the interference of environmental factors. We compare several classical neural networks and validate them on dataset collected from AUVs sea trials. The experimental results show that our proposed method has high recognition speed and recognition accuracy.},

   abstract = {This paper presents SVIn2, a novel tightly-coupled keyframe-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, which fuses Scanning Profiling Sonar, Visual, Inertial, and water-pressure information in a non-linear optimization framework for small and large scale challenging underwater environments. The developed real-time system features robust initialization, loop-closing, and relocalization capabilities, which make the system reliable in the presence of haze, blurriness, low light, and lighting variations, typically observed in underwater scenarios. Over the last decade, Visual-Inertial Odometry and SLAM systems have shown excellent performance for mobile robots in indoor and outdoor environments, but often fail underwater due to the inherent difficulties in such environments. Our approach combats the weaknesses of previous approaches by utilizing additional sensors and exploiting their complementary characteristics. In particular, we use (1) acoustic range information for improved reconstruction and localization, thanks to the reliable distance measurement; (2) depth information from water-pressure sensor for robust initialization, refining the scale, and assisting to limit the drift in the tightly-coupled integration. The developed software—made open source—has been successfully used to test and validate the proposed system in both benchmark datasets and numerous real world underwater scenarios, including datasets collected with a custom-made underwater sensor suite and an autonomous underwater vehicle Aqua2. SVIn2 demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of accuracy and robustness on those datasets and enabled other robotic tasks, for example, planning for underwater robots in presence of obstacles.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to guide and control an autonomous underwater vehicle into the entrance of a docking station by mapping camera input to an error signal. An external positioning system synchronized with the internal sensors of the vehicle is to obtain a dataset of images matched with the position and heading of the vehicle. By using a guidance map, each position is converted into a desired heading that guides the vehicle into the docking station. The CNN is then trained to estimate, for each frame, the error between the desired vehicle heading and the actual heading of the vehicle. After the training period, the camera input and the CNN are used to control the vehicle towards the docking station, achieving autonomous docking. To enhance the stability of the docking, the paper proposes a transformation of the polar coordinates that avoids large angular errors when reaching the entrance of the docking station. The proposed framework is implemented, and experimental data from a mission are presented.},

   abstract = {Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation, which can effectively prevent battery overcharge and over-discharge, provide accurate driving range and extend battery life, is challenging due to complicated battery dynamics and ever-changing ambient conditions. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based data-driven method for SOC estimation of Li-ion Batteries is proposed. First, the model characteristic parameters are dynamically tracked through the recursive least squares method. Then the filtered output result of the EKF algorithm reflecting the battery's dynamic characteristics is used as the training data of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. Benefit from the XGBoost's excellent machine learning and predictive capabilities, which can realize the battery's SOC high-precision prediction based on the EKF algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed XGBoost algorithm, especially in the low SOC range, has good convergence and robustness, compared with the EKF algorithm and the library for support vector machines (LIBSVM) algorithm. The algorithm is validated under different driving conditions and achieves accurate SOC estimation with a maximum absolute error of less than 2%. It can be easily concluded that the proposed method can achieve accurate and stable SOC estimation, effectively avoiding the open-loop risk of data-driven algorithms.},

   abstract = {Low-level control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been extensively addressed by classical control techniques. However, the variable operating conditions and hostile environments faced by AUVs have driven researchers towards the formulation of adaptive control approaches. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is a powerful framework which has been applied in different formulations of adaptive control strategies for AUVs. However, the limitations of RL approaches have lead towards the emergence of deep reinforcement learning which has become an attractive and promising framework for developing real adaptive control strategies to solve complex control problems for autonomous systems. However, most of the existing applications of deep RL use video images to train the decision making artificial agent but obtaining camera images only for an AUV control purpose could be costly in terms of energy consumption. Moreover, the rewards are not easily obtained directly from the video frames. In this work we develop a deep RL framework for adaptive control applications of AUVs based on an actor-critic goal-oriented deep RL architecture, which takes the available raw sensory information as input and as output the continuous control actions which are the low-level commands for the AUV's thrusters. Experiments on a real AUV demonstrate the applicability of the stated deep RL approach for an autonomous robot control problem.},

   abstract = {TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE - The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. * Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.

First, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation platform ANSYS Fluent is used to solve for the main hydrodynamic coefficients required to establish the AUV dynamic model. Then, the novel model predictive controller is used to obtain the desired velocity command of the AUV. To reduce the influence of external interference and realize accurate velocity tracking, dynamic SMC is used to obtain the control input command. In addition, stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method proves the asymptotic stability of the controller. Finally, the trajectory tracking performance of the AUV in an underwater, three-dimensional environment is verified by using the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform.

   abstract = {Underwater robots are used in surveillance, academic and military applications because of their capability to execute risky tasks underwater without human intervention. In this study, a robot is built at low cost budget to carry out inspection at specified depth in a water body. Preliminary studies are performed to understand the buoyancy and stability of an underwater robot. Different configurations of propeller arrangements are identified and the final prototype is arrived after meeting the specific application requirements. Dual grippers are incorporated with the underwater robot, one for holding the pipe to avoid underwater currents and other for gripping/releasing the pipe. Gyroscope sensor is embodied in the underwater robot to maintain stability from its feedback signals. A high definition camera is mounted in front of the underwater robot for live video and image capturing purposes. Thus the underwater robot is able to meet all its requirements with minimal frontal drag. For validation purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies are carried out with dynamic meshes and boundary conditions. The deviation between CFD and experimental results is found to be within the acceptable limits. The detailed cost analysis for the construction and testing of this underwater robot is also briefly tabulated.},

However, current developments in reinforcement learning show promising results for robotics applications. In particular underwater autonomous vehicles could benefit from this new techniques, achieving adaptive behavior for real-time problem solving. Based on this developments the navigation problem is solved using deep reinforcement learning, in particular the deep deterministic policy gradient. In this proposal a model free approach is used, where the raw sensor information is used as inputs to a policy network, and the outputs of this network are directly mapped to the thrusters. In addition an adaptive goal driven architecture is used to allow the agent to reach variable way points consistently.

   abstract = {This work investigates discrete-time 3D trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to input saturation and unknown environmental disturbances. Firstly, a line-of-sight strategy is proposed to achieve local re-planning. The re-planned trajectory is employed in controller design to restrict the magnitude of tracking errors, mitigating abrupt changes in velocity and control input. Secondly, the robustness to environmental disturbances is achieved by employing a tube-based model predictive controller. The control scheme consists of two controllers: one is a model predictive controller based on the nominal AUV model for reference tracking, and the other is a state-dependent feedback controller used to construct time-varying tubes so as to ensure that the perturbed system remains within a tube centered around the nominal trajectory. Under given assumptions, the proposed controller guarantees (local) input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. Thirdly, a rate of energy consumption metric is formulated to assess the control performance. Simulation studies under realistic ocean environmental conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with a nonlinear model predictive controller.},

   abstract = {Robotic systems are one of the primary tools used in the exploration of the world's oceans. These technologies have limitations related to speed, efficiency, maneuverability, and prolonged operation in ocean environments. To address and overcome these limitations, systems are being developed utilizing bio-inspired features and different swim modes. This leads to an issue where there is not a consistent measure with which can accurately predict the performance of platforms across many different swim modes. One widely used metric is the Cost of Transport over Reynolds number and displacements, in the form of a scaling law, which is a measure of the energy used for any given operation, but is highly dependent on the swimming mode and geometry of the platform. More recently, the Swim number was introduced that unifies the kinematics and fluid properties of many different aquatic animals and swim modes under a single scaling law. In this work, we introduce a Swim number for propeller driven autonomous swimmers as a unified performance metric. We review the Cost of Transport and Swim number for biological, bio-inspired, and conventional swimmers and provide new scaling laws. The analysis shows that both performance metrics taken together, Cost of Transport and Swim Number, are convenient when designing and comparing natural and artificial swimmers.},

First, the dynamics of the vehicle is transformed into the so-called regular form. Then, based on the Extended State Observer technique and High Order Sliding Modes Control, a disturbance observer is proposed. Furthermore, the gains of the observer are automatically adjusted by the introduction of an adaption law. The stability of the whole controller/observer scheme is proven using Lyapunov's arguments. The adaptive disturbance observer aims to improve the Backstepping and nonlinear PD controllers.

The SAP conforms to the A-size standard and when paired with the corresponding air-dropped components, can transition between various operational forms, including folding into a compact barrel shape, air-dropping with a parachute, and spreading wings after entering the water. As a novel type of specialized underwater vehicle, the SAP has undergone miniaturization, lightweight, and folding design, which impose certain constraints on its movement capabilities. The concept of ocean current velocity stratification has been introduced to enhance the ability to correct positional offsets caused by ocean currents. By proposing a current velocity scale factor, the depth-averaged ocean current velocity is divided into low velocity in deep-water areas and high velocity in shallow-water areas. Gliding with different pitch angles within different current velocity layers can maximize the characteristics of decreasing current velocity with increasing depth and improve the efficiency of displacement correction. This strategy termed the variable pitch angle virtual mooring strategy, has been demonstrated to be effective through both kinematic simulations and lake trials.},

Considering the large number of coupling between six-degree-of-freedom underactuated UUV of unknown dynamic models, traditional model-based control methods are difficult to effectively solve the three-dimensional path control problem. A self-attention based soft actor and critic (A-SAC) algorithm is designed to learn effective control policy from random paths. The problem of limited target acquisition by UUV in the actual underwater environment is effectively overcome, which is mainly caused by the inability of UUV to consistently receive information about their expected path. A new state space is designed and a self-attention mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of using discontinuous path information. Furthermore, the validation experiment compares classical Reinforcement Learning methods such as DDPG, PPO, and etc. Compared to other existing methods, the proposed A-SAC algorithm can more quickly and effectively learn the path control policy for a six-degree-of-freedom UUV that operates in a complex environment.},

   abstract = {Nonlinear inertial flows usually influence the motion of swimming organisms, but most studies focus on the tractable case of swimmers too small to feel such effects. A mechanistic principle now unifies the varied dynamics of macroscopic swimmers. Inertial aquatic swimmers that use undulatory gaits range in length L from a few millimetres to 30 metres, across a wide array of biological taxa. Using elementary hydrodynamic arguments, we uncover a unifying mechanistic principle characterizing their locomotion by deriving a scaling relation that links swimming speed U to body kinematics (tail beat amplitude A and frequency ω) and fluid properties (kinematic viscosity ν). This principle can be simply couched as the power law Re ∼ Swα, where Re = UL/ν ≫ 1 and Sw = ω AL/ν, with α = 4/3 for laminar flows, and α = 1 for turbulent flows. Existing data from over 1,000 measurements on fish, amphibians, larvae, reptiles, mammals and birds, as well as direct numerical simulations are consistent with our scaling. We interpret our results as the consequence of the convergence of aquatic gaits to the performance limits imposed by hydrodynamics.},

Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows.

Initially, the external disturbances and internal uncertainties of each AUV were precisely compensated using the designed FFTESO. Subsequently, we proposed DLMPC-based position tracking and velocity tracking controllers, which solved an online optimization problem to determine optimal velocities and control forces. This hierarchical framework effectively managed system constraints, such as state constraints and actuator saturation. Additionally, the Lyapunov-based backstepping control law was applied to construct stability constraints in the distributed optimization problem, ensuring the recursive feasibility and closed-loop system stability of the proposed scheme. Sufficient conditions and attraction regions to ensure stability were explicitly provided. Finally, the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method improved both the convergence speed and tracking accuracy by at least 30% compared to other methods.},

   abstract = {As a new type of marine unmanned intelligent equipment, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been widely used in the field of ocean observation, maritime rescue, mine countermeasures, intelligence reconnaissance, etc. Especially in the underwater search mission, the technical advantages of AUV are particularly obvious. However, limited operational capability and sophisticated mission environments are also difficulties faced by AUV. To make better use of AUV in the search mission, we establish the DMACSS (distributed multi-AUVs collaborative search system) and propose the ACSLA (autonomous collaborative search learning algorithm) integrated into the DMACSS. Compared with the previous system, DMACSS adopts a distributed control structure to improve the system robustness and combines an information fusion mechanism and a time stamp mechanism, making each AUV in the system able to exchange and fuse information during the mission. ACSLA is an adaptive learning algorithm trained by the RL (Reinforcement learning) method with a tailored design of state information, reward function, and training framework, which can give the system optimal search path in real-time according to the environment. We test DMACSS and ACSLA in the simulation test. The test results demonstrate that the DMACSS runs stably, the search accuracy and efficiency of ACSLA outperform other search methods, thus better realizing the cooperation between AUVs, making the DMACSS find the target more accurately and faster.},

   abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are widely used for the inspection of seabed pipelines. To address the issues of low trajectory tracking accuracy in AUV inspection processes due to uncertain ocean current disturbances, this paper designs a new dual-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Variable Universe S-plane algorithms (S-VUD FLC, where VUD represents Variable Universe Discourse and FLC represents Fuzzy Logic Control) to achieve three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory tracking of an over-actuated AUV under uncertain ocean current disturbances. This paper uses MPC as the outer-loop position controller and S-VUD FLC as the inner-loop speed controller. The outer-loop controller generates desired speed instructions that are passed to the inner-loop speed controller, while the inner-loop speed controller generates control input and uses a direct logic thrust distribution method that approaches optimal energy consumption to distribute the thrust generated by the propellers to the over-actuated AUV, achieving closed-loop tracking of the entire trajectory. When designing the outer-loop MPC controller, the actual control input constraints of the system are considered, and control increments are introduced to reduce control model errors and the impact of uncertain external disturbances on the actual AUV model parameters. When designing the inner-loop S-VUD FLC, the strong robustness of the variable universe fuzzy controller and the easy construction characteristics of the S-plane algorithm are combined, and integral action is introduced to improve the system’s tracking accuracy. The stability of the outer loop controller is proven by the Lyapunov method, and the stability of the inner loop controller is verified by simulation. Finally, simulations show that the over-actuated AUV has fast tracking processes and high tracking result accuracy under uncertain ocean current disturbances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the designed dual-loop controller.},

   abstract = {Sea turtles gracefully navigate their marine environments by flapping their pectoral flippers in an elegant routine to produce the required hydrodynamic forces required for locomotion. The propulsion of sea turtles has been shown to occur for approximately 30% of the limb beat, with the remaining 70% employing a drag-reducing glide. However, it is unknown how the sea turtle manipulates the flow during the propulsive stage. Answering this research question is a complicated process, especially when conducting laboratory tests on endangered animals, and the animal may not even swim with its regular routine while in a captive state. In this work, we take advantage of our robotic sea turtle, internally known as Cornelia, to offer the first insights into the flow features during the sea turtle’s propulsion cycle consisting of the downstroke and the sweep stroke. Comparing the flow features to the animal’s swim speed, flipper angle of attack, power consumption, thrust and lift production, we hypothesise how each of the flow features influences the animal’s propulsive efforts and cost of transport (COT). Our findings show that the sea turtle can produce extremely low COT values that point to the effectiveness of the sea turtle propulsive technique. Based on our findings, we extract valuable data that can potentially lead to turtle-inspired elements for high-efficiency underwater drones for long-term underwater missions.},

   abstract = {Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation, which can effectively prevent battery overcharge and over-discharge, provide accurate driving range and extend battery life, is challenging due to complicated battery dynamics and ever-changing ambient conditions. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based data-driven method for SOC estimation of Li-ion Batteries is proposed. First, the model characteristic parameters are dynamically tracked through the recursive least squares method. Then the filtered output result of the EKF algorithm reflecting the battery's dynamic characteristics is used as the training data of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. Benefit from the XGBoost's excellent machine learning and predictive capabilities, which can realize the battery's SOC high-precision prediction based on the EKF algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed XGBoost algorithm, especially in the low SOC range, has good convergence and robustness, compared with the EKF algorithm and the library for support vector machines (LIBSVM) algorithm. The algorithm is validated under different driving conditions and achieves accurate SOC estimation with a maximum absolute error of less than 2%. It can be easily concluded that the proposed method can achieve accurate and stable SOC estimation, effectively avoiding the open-loop risk of data-driven algorithms.},

The developed real-time system features robust initialization, loop-closing, and relocalization capabilities, which make the system reliable in the presence of haze, blurriness, low light, and lighting variations, typically observed in underwater scenarios. Over the last decade, Visual-Inertial Odometry and SLAM systems have shown excellent performance for mobile robots in indoor and outdoor environments, but often fail underwater due to the inherent difficulties in such environments. Our approach combats the weaknesses of previous approaches by utilizing additional sensors and exploiting their complementary characteristics. In particular, we use (1) acoustic range information for improved reconstruction and localization, thanks to the reliable distance measurement; (2) depth information from water-pressure sensor for robust initialization, refining the scale, and assisting to limit the drift in the tightly-coupled integration. The developed software—made open source—has been successfully used to test and validate the proposed system in both benchmark datasets and numerous real world underwater scenarios, including datasets collected with a custom-made underwater sensor suite and an autonomous underwater vehicle Aqua2. SVIn2 demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of accuracy and robustness on those datasets and enabled other robotic tasks, for example, planning for underwater robots in presence of obstacles.},

An external positioning system synchronized with the internal sensors of the vehicle is to obtain a dataset of images matched with the position and heading of the vehicle. By using a guidance map, each position is converted into a desired heading that guides the vehicle into the docking station. The CNN is then trained to estimate, for each frame, the error between the desired vehicle heading and the actual heading of the vehicle. After the training period, the camera input and the CNN are used to control the vehicle towards the docking station, achieving autonomous docking. To enhance the stability of the docking, the paper proposes a transformation of the polar coordinates that avoids large angular errors when reaching the entrance of the docking station.

   abstract = {This paper presents an extensive analysis of the integral line-of-sight (ILOS) guidance method for path-following tasks of underactuated marine vehicles, operating on and below the sea surface. It is shown that due to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines by compensating for the drift effect of environmental disturbances, such as currents, wind, and waves. The ILOS guidance is first applied to a 2-D model of surface vessels that includes the underactauted sway dynamics of the vehicle as well as disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, and forces. The actuated dynamics are not considered at this point. A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The actuated surge, pitch, and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis where the closed-loop system forms a cascade, and the properties of UGAS and ULES are shown. The 3-D ILOS control system is a generalization of the 2-D ILOS guidance. Finally, results from simulations and experiments are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results, where the 2-D ILOS guidance is applied to the cooperative autonomous robotics towing system vehicle and light AUV.},

This collaboration between AI and biomimicry marks a new era for AUVs, enabling them to emulate marine creatures' graceful and efficient movements. By infusing AI capabilities into AUVs, AUVs are empowered to learn and adapt, making autonomous real-time decisions without human intervention. This dynamic integration equips AUVs to effectively navigate complex underwater terrains, evade obstacles, and seamlessly interact with marine life. Inspired by the remarkable propulsion mechanisms found in marine organisms, this work proposes a pioneering propulsion system tailored for AUVs. Taking cues from the locomotion of creatures like cuttlefish, the biomechanics is translated into a robotic propulsion system. The result is a fluid and energy-efficient propulsion method that mitigates the harmful effects of cavitation, thereby reducing noise pollution and minimizing disruption to marine ecosystems. This research evaluates the performance of on-device AI models for analyzing the sensing environment around the AUV and taking real-time images. This automated sensing and navigation method can help the AUVs independently navigate to the desired location along the water table. The propulsion is achieved by building a crankshaft mechanism and a unified mechanical design to convert rotational motion from a motor into a sinusoidal wave motion to replicate the cuttlefish locomotion pattern. The proposed underwater vehicle, Aquabot, is designed using Fusion 360 simulation and ANSYS software. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the autonomous underwater vehicle based on the environmental conditions, thus reducing energy consumption and enhancing aquatic vehicle efficiency.},

Firstly, we introduce a dynamic local self-attention to adaptively capture important spatial details in degraded underwater images by employing dynamic weighting. Secondly, considering that visual transformers tend to introduce irrelevant information when modeling the global context, thereby interfering with the reconstruction of high-resolution images, we design a sparse non-local self-attention to more accurately compute self-similarity by setting a top-k threshold. Finally, we integrate these two self-attention mechanisms into the hybrid dynamic transformer module, constituting the primary feature extraction unit of our proposed method.

In this work, with the help of robotics, we tested the suitability of a prosthetic flipper for sea turtles that have lost a flipper. Testing with our sea-turtle-inspired robot helped to demonstrate the prosthetic flipper’s performance without clinical trials in live animals. The robot showed that the prosthetic could closely mimic the sea turtle’s downstroke and upstroke, allowing the animal to regain control in roll, pitch, and yaw, despite the absence of anatomical joints and related muscles. Additionally, swim speed tests provided an average swim speed of 0.487 m/s while dragging 6 m of cable to give a calculated maximum swim speed of 0.618 m/s, coming close to the average swim speed of wild sea turtles of 0.6 m/s. Our aspiration is that the findings from this study will pave the way for an open-source implant design, empowering veterinary professionals globally to aid injured turtles. Furthermore, this research promises to inspire additional animal-based robotic designs, advancing technologies geared towards assisting other animals in distress.},

   abstract = {An improved adaptive integral line-of-sight guidance law and path following control system for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) with uncertainties is proposed in this paper. The dynamic equations of the tracking errors are established in the Serret-Frenet coordinate system with the consideration of the time-varying ocean currents. In order to eliminate tracking errors, three adaptive variables are constructed to design the guidance law instead of the unmeasurable ocean currents and sideslip angle, and the adaptive variables are adjusted online according to the tracking errors. The desired heading angle is computed by using the designed guidance law, then a heading controller based on backstepping method is designed to track the desired heading angle, so as to realize the path following of USVs. The designed guidance subsystem is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov method, and the simulation results show that the path following control system designed in this paper can make the USV follow the desired path quickly and accurately.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a fixed-time sliding mode controller (FSMC) with disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under time-varying external disturbances. Firstly, by using the sliding mode control method, an FSMC is proposed for reducing the tracking errors. Secondly, considering the estimation problem of time-varying disturbances, a fixed-time DO is designed to reconstruct the information of the AUV. Finally, The DO can compensate time-varying disturbances and the FSMC can reduce the tracking errors incorporating the information from the DO. Thus, the FSMC-DO for AUV is derived. Compared with the conventional FSMC and the finite time controller, the proposed FSMC-DO not only offers a faster convergence rate but also a higher tracking accuracy and robustness for the trajectory tracking control of AUVs. Simulation results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed FSMC-DO.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to achieve the trajectory-tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of random system uncertainties and external current disturbances. A comprehensive model of an AUV is developed based on its kinematic and dynamic models. By means of appropriate transformations, a new system dynamic equation with arguments of positions and orientations is obtained for the controller design. Here, a proposed finite-time robust tracking control (FTRTC) based on a nonlinear sliding surface constructed using the tracking error which leads not only to trajectory-tracking of the AUV system with a finite-time convergence, but also a high level of robust performance. The stability of the overall system is assured via the Lyapunov stability criteria. Computer simulations conducted using the developed controller demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FTRTC. Moreover, the simulation results showed that the proposed control scheme resulted in a high level of robustness of the closed-loop control system.},
